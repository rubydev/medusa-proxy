= Proxy

A simple, balanced proxy server which forwards requests to a backend / another proxy.

== Usage overview

Start the proxy with command:

    $ bundle exec bin/medusa start --ontop

Now connect to the internet via forwarded proxy:

    $ curl --proxy1.0 localhost:9999 "http://example.com"

or use the provided script, which sends multiple requests in one go:

    $ ruby clients.rb

and watch the colorized traffic flowing in your terminal.

== Installation

You need the Bundler gem:

    $ bundle install

== Usage in production

The application contains an executable script which runs the server in the background, saves a PID file and logs output.

First, provide the application with an URL to a list of backend proxies:

    $ cp config/config.example.rb config/config.rb
    $ vim config/config.example.rb

Then start the server (be sure to use the `bundle exec` command, to resolve dependencies):

    $ bundle exec bin/medusa start -- production

Check that the server is running correctly:

    $ ls -l log/medusa.pid
    $ tail log/medusa.output
    $ ps ax | grep medusa

You can monitor the service as you wish based on the PID file.


== TODO:

* Load proxy list from REST service
* Save "total" stats to Redis asynchronically
* Implement health check for proxies (asynchronically? perform union of sorted set with healthy proxies set?)
* Create frontend web application with EventMachine and WebSockets to monitor the server
