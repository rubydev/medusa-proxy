= Proxy

A simple, balanced proxy server which forwards requests to a backend / another proxy.

Start the proxy with command:

  $ ruby proxy.rb

Now connect to the internet via forwarded proxy:

  $ curl --proxy1.0 localhost:9999 "http://example.com"

or use the provided script, which sends multiple requests in one go:

  $ ruby clients


== TODO:

* Implement health check for proxies (asynchronically? perform union of sorted set with healthy proxies set?)
* Gemify
* Daemonize
* Tests
